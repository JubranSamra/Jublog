**Summary**  
_ORBIS: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World_ is a detailed model of ancient Roman travel routes. It uses historical and comparative data to provide insight into the cost and time expense of ancient Roman travel based on several user-inputted variables. The ORBIS model allows for numerous modes of travel, by water as well as by land. The conditions depicted mainly represent those around 200 CE, but some routes created as late as 700 CE are also included. The project directors are very clear that this model seeks to capture the shape of the system as a whole but cannot be relied on to reflect the experience of an individual travel with perfect accuracy.

**Design**  
ORBIS was created using several datasets. It uses numerous algorithmic functions to define the relationships between data sets. To do this, the creators used PostgreSQL, which is an object-relational database, as well as PostGIS2, which is software that allows PostgreSQL to support geographic objects.

ORBIS dashboard is familiar and fairly easy-to-use for anyone with experience in Google Maps because the directors included many features that are commonly used in other GIS (geographic information system) software. 

**Relevance**  
This project is impressive in its use of numerous data processing and geospatial mapping techniques. Through a cutting-edge integration of modern technology and ancient data, ORBIS provides a unique insight into Roman travel. Although the information it provides sheds light on the big picture of ancient Rome’s travel networks, the directors are very transparent about its limitations and flaws. By their highly critical analysis of ORBIS, its’ creators have done an excellent job of outlining specific improvements to be made in later projects. 

**Credit**  
According to the Credits section, ORBIS was designed by Walter Scheidel, a Roman historian at Stanford. Working closely with him, a team of three IT experts brought the project to life. The team received help from a multitude of experts, from Stanford and elsewhere. The interface and functionality of ORBIS was supported by Stanford University Library and the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. The funding for the project came from a Stanford Digital Humanities grant.

**Findings**  
_ORBIS: The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World_ is a polished, user-friendly tool that uses cutting edge data processing to give its users unique insight into the Roman world. 

This project does a great job of being as easy as possible for a user to understand. The directors provided detailed instructions for how to use the site, as well as video tutorials.

The site is easy to navigate, with labelled subheadings and subsections to direct the user. Images are also well-labelled. Many of the buttons on the interface are described in popup labels when highlighted over, and the buttons that don’t have an explanation should be easy enough to understand without one.

While the overall design of the site is impressive, it is clearly not made to be used on a mobile device, as the text becomes uncomfortably small to read, and many of the site’s popups become clunky and annoying to use.

Also, it’s unclear why the creators of the site didn’t include an option in the interface’s Display section to overlay elevation data onto their map of the Roman landscape, as it is relevant data which they used to build their model, and they even included an elevation map as Figure 7 of the Geospatial subsection.

Overall, this project is built excellently. Those who made ORBIS were honest and informative about its limitations as well as its features. The site is very clear about what it sets out to do, and it does it effectively.
