### Who I am
I am a **21 year-old senior**, majoring in **Marketing**. I'm from **Ashburn, Virginia**. I have an older brother, studying neuroscience. (He is smarter than me) And I have a 16 year-old cockapoo named **Kiwi**, who we got when I was five.

### Before College
Growing up **homeschooled**, I had a childhood that was fairly different than public-schoolers. I spent much less time studying academic subjects, and more time pursuing things I was interested in. The stereotype of homeschoolers not being socialized isn't entirely accurate. I had a good amount of friends, and I spent a good amount of time out of the house, taking classes or playing sports. But, when I finally entered public school in 8th grade I was undoubtedly lagging behind my peers in social skills. It really wasn't until my junior year of high school, when I joined the **Varsity Tennis Team** that I'd say I didn't feel like an outsider. But nowadays, my life as a homeschooler is something I rarely think about except to joke about it.

As a teenager, I became interested in **PC gaming**, building several PCs and frequently playing games with friends from school. For years, my favorite game was **Overwatch**. I climbed the competitive ladder and became better at it than all my friends. For a long time I held the highest rank in the game, **Top 500**. That meant I was one of the 500 highest ranked players. I would go on to play on the **CNU Overwatch team** for my first two years of school. Although the team no longer exists, it was a fun experience. We practiced a good amount, playing scrimmages against other schools, and we were a surprisingly good team for a smaller school. We were ranked #7 out of 600+ collegiate teams in the US. I'm not interested in Overwatch anymore, though. And I rarely play videogames.

Back to high school, I tutored in the writing center, played tennis, joined the French club, and participated in FBLA, even winning 2nd place in a regional conference. Toward the end of high school, I got diagnosed with **ADHD**. I don't really mind having ADHD. I actually credit my success in certain areas of my life to it. Somehow I graduated, despite my senioritis. I worked at Pet Supplies Plus for a summer and then left for CNU.

### My Life Right Now
Being my last semester before I graduate, it had to be my busiest. My Capstone class, the CapSim Global business simulation, is pretty much regarded as the final boss of the Luter business school. Between that, my other classes, and my **part-time marketing job** with a mid-sized government contractor in Reston, VA, I don't have as much free time as I'd like. I can deal with that though, because I'm motivated by the fact that I'll be done with school soon. My family is currently in the process of moving to **Alexandria**, so I'm also excited for the new people and places I'll get to know after school.

In the free time I do have, you can find me listening to **metal** at the gym or watching a show on Disney+ with friends. **Fitness** has actually been my biggest passion for 2-3 years now. I've enjoyed learning about **exercise and nutrition**, and getting in better shape through the process. My top gym goal right now is to hit a one-arm chinup, as **chinups** are my best exercise. My favorite thing about the gym lifestyle is progressing. I found that, during the isolation at the beginning of the pandemic, it greatly helped my mental health to spend that time **working on myself**.
