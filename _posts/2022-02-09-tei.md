## Introduction:
For this assignment, our class went through the process of encoding a passage of text in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). TEI is a set of standard guidelines which specifies methods for digitally encoding text.
The passages we used were taken from _Dracula’s Guest_, a short story by Bram Stoker. The first step of this assignment was to, in Google Docs, mark every place in the text where we would need to use TEI tags. Next, we set up a TEI document in Oxygen XML editor to encode the text in TEI. The following sections will include more detail on the process of annotating and encoding.

## Google Docs:
In Google Docs, we first annotated the document using comments. Rather than including full TEI tags, we only made short notes of the type of TEI tag that would be needed. Despite there being many types of TEI tags, I only needed to use two. See the image below for my annotated passage.

## Oxygen:
In Oxygen XML editor, we first created an XML file before making some modifications. We fixed a typo in Bram Stoker’s name, and we included our own name in the “editor” tag. We then pasted our text inside the “body” tag. 
The annotations we took in Google Docs made it much easier to include our TEI tags as needed. I’m not familiar with software like XML editor, so I was initially a little overwhelmed. But I was able to do what I needed to by carefully following instructions and using the annotations from Google Docs. In the image below, you can see my file in Oxygen and the tags I used in the body section.

## Conclusion:
	This assignment gave me a better understanding of what goes into digitally encoding a piece of text. With plenty of instructions, it wasn’t so hard to learn the very basics of TEI. However, I do think my passage of text was easier to encode than many of my classmates’. The tags I had to use weren’t very complex, and I only needed a handful.
